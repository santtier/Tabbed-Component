# Tabbed-Component
This Tabbed component lets you show and hide contents. It is similar to tabs in your browser, but you use them inside the page. It has keyboard interaction and I add accesibility.
Also I use OOP to make this component reusable in any website.

## Collaboration
Give instructions on how to collaborate with your project.
There are a set of rules to keep in mind:

- Perform work in a feature branch.
  _Why:_
  > Because this way all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch. It allows you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code. [read more...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)
- Branch out from `main`

  _Why:_

  > This way, you can make sure that code in master will almost always build without problems, and can be mostly used directly for releases (this might be overkill for some projects).

- Never push into `main` branch. Make a Pull Request.

  _Why:_

  > It notifies team members that they have completed a feature. It also enables easy peer-review of the code and dedicates forum for discussing the proposed feature.

- Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.
  _Why:_
  > It will clutter up your list of branches with dead branches. It ensures you only ever merge the branch back into (`main`) once. Feature branches should only exist while the work is still in progress.

- Comment your code. Try to make it as clear as possible.
- Don't use comments as an excuse for a bad code. Keep your code clean.
- Don't use clean code as an excuse to not comment at all.
- Keep comments relevant as your code evolves.
